# used-cars-log-trans

This is the accompanying repository for the blog post [Honey, I shrunk the target variable].
Find the `used-cars` notebook in the `notebooks` folder.

## Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. create an environment `used-cars-log-trans` with the help of [conda],
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with
   ```
   conda activate used-cars-log-trans
   ```
3. start JupyterLab with:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

Then take a look into the `notebooks` folder.
